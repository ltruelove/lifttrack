LiftTrack
=========

This is to help me track my weights and not have to write it down on paper anymore. Ideally I'll get to the point where I can create a lift and set my start and work set weights and have it calculate the warm-ups in between.

I'd like to eventually add the ability to set up a program template that you could base your day's program off of and anything else that might be fun.
